  <div id="aboutText">
    <p>When it comes to building websites, I believe it’s not just about creating something that looks good—it’s about designing an experience that connects, engages, and converts. My name is Keith Gotohori, and I specialize in crafting websites that combine creativity, strategy, and technology to help businesses grow faster and stand out online.</p>

    <p>Over the years, I’ve discovered that a website is often the first impression a client or customer has of a brand. That’s why I approach every project with one mission in mind: to create a digital presence that makes people stop, explore, and take action. Whether it’s a small startup looking to break into the market or an established company ready to scale, I design websites that speak directly to the audience and inspire trust.</p>

    <h3>Why Web Design Is More Than Just Design</h3>
    <p>For me, web design is not about pushing pixels or adding flashy graphics—it’s about solving problems. Every color, button, word, and image has a purpose. My designs are built with the end user in mind: clear layouts, fast-loading pages, mobile-friendly interfaces, and smooth navigation. When all these elements work together, they don’t just create a beautiful site—they create results.</p>

    <p>I understand that in today’s digital age, a website has to do more than look attractive. It needs to work like a business tool. That’s why I make sure every site I design is optimized for performance, search engines, and user experience. A good website should generate leads, boost sales, and strengthen a brand’s reputation. That’s what I deliver.</p>

    <h3>My Approach</h3>
    <p>What sets me apart is my hands-on, personalized approach to web design. I don’t believe in one-size-fits-all templates. Every client is unique, and so is every project. Before I write a single line of code or design a single section, I take the time to understand my client’s business, goals, and audience.</p>

    <p>From there, I map out a clear strategy that focuses on results. This could mean creating a sleek portfolio site for a creative professional, an e-commerce platform that converts visitors into loyal buyers, or a business website that positions a brand as an industry leader. My process is transparent, collaborative, and always focused on delivering more than expected.</p>

    <h3>What Clients Can Expect</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Professionalism:</strong> Clear communication, timely delivery, and complete dedication to your project.</li>
      <li><strong>Creativity:</strong> Designs that are modern, visually appealing, and aligned with your brand identity.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical Expertise:</strong> Clean, responsive, and secure code that ensures your website runs smoothly across all devices.</li>
      <li><strong>Results-Driven Mindset:</strong> Every design choice is backed by strategy to maximize conversions and impact.</li>
      <li><strong>Support:</strong> I don’t just deliver a website and disappear. I provide ongoing guidance, updates, and support to keep your site ahead of the curve.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why Choose Me</h3>
    <p>There are thousands of web designers out there, but what makes me different is my balance of creativity and strategy. I know how to make websites that don’t just impress but also perform. I stay updated with the latest trends, technologies, and design practices so my clients can always expect cutting-edge solutions.</p>

    <p>More importantly, I treat every project as if it were my own. I pour passion, precision, and attention to detail into every page I create. For me, your success is my success.</p>

    <h3>Let’s Build Something Remarkable</h3>
    <p>If you’re looking for a web designer who can deliver more than just a nice-looking website—someone who can help you create a powerful online presence that brings real results—you’re in the right place.</p>

    <p>Let’s work together to build a site that not only represents your brand but also inspires your audience to take action. The digital world is moving fast, but with the right website, your business can move even faster.</p>
